            This entity will be used to determine if we still have to do a backup
            on automation start - so it is for inner workings of this automation.

            This saves you from getting multiple backups in the same update window.

            Maximum time to wait for each update to complete.

            This protects the automation of waiting forever for an update that fails.

            Usually updates don't take that very long,
            so feel free to ajust this time to something that fits better your environment.

            The default is 600 seconds (10 minutes).
            You can select any value between 10 seconds and 7200 seconds (2 hours).

            If an update times out:
            - The automation will log an error message
            - The automation will continue with the next update
            - The timed-out update may still complete in the background
